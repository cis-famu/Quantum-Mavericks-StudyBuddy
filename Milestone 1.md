-	Will not handle official student grading or professor-specific course management tasks
-	Will not facilitate direct communication between students and professors within the platform

Constraints List any conditions that may limit the project team’s options with respect to resources, personnel, or schedule (e.g., predetermined budget or project end date, limit on number of staff that may be assigned to the project).
*	Fixed Timeline - The project must be fully outlined by April 25, 2025, and fully developed and implemented by December 5, 2025, in alignment with course schedule
*	Limited Team Size - The project team consists of four members, restricting workload distribution and available development capacity
*	Resource Availability - Access to AI development tools, LMS APIs, and cloud storage may be limited or require approval from external entities
*	Skillset Limitations - The team may have limited expertise in AI development, API integration, or full-stack system implementation, requiring learning time
*	Testing & User Feedback  - Student adoption and testing may be limited due to time constraints or difficulty recruiting test users before the final deployment
External Dependencies Will project success depend on coordination of efforts between the project team and one or more other individuals or groups? Has everyone involved agreed to this interaction?
*	LMS Integration - The project depends on the availability and accessibility of Canvas or other LMS APIs for assignment tracking and schedule integration. Any restrictions or lack of API access could impact functionality
*	University IT Policies & Data Access - If integration with the university systems is required, project success depends on compliance with institutional IT policies and obtaining necessary permissions.
*	AI Model Development & Training Data - The effectiveness of AI-driven study recommendations relies on access to sufficient user interactions data, which may be limited during initial development
*	Potential Faculty/Advisor Input - Educators and academic advisors may provide insights for system reports and recommendations. Their involvement is not guaranteed, which could impact report accuracy
5. Communication Strategy (specify how the project manager will communicate to the Executive Sponsor, Project Team members and Stakeholders, e.g., frequency of status reports, frequency of Project Team meetings, etc.
*	Project Manager Communication
-	Weekly team meetings will be held to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps
-	Biweekly status reports will be discussed with Executive Sponsor to provide key project updates
-	Monthly progress summaries will be shared with between group and sponsors
