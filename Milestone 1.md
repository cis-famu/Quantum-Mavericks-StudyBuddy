## SWOT Analysis

SWOT Analysis of StudyBuddy

Strengths: 
All-in-one tool for students: By focusing on our main target audience, students, we will be able to aid them in getting better grades.
Opportunity to work with brands: With this being a newer tool with the right connections we can partner with larger brands as well as do collaborations to promote StudyBuddy.

Weaknesses: 
Learning the skills to code the project: We will require extra training while working on our project to receive the best outcome.
Slow start-up: There may not be many people on the app at first, so it'll be harder to receive feedback.

Opportunities:
 Helping students learn how to develop better study habits.
High Demand: While there are other apps out there, people are constantly looking for a new study tool to help them.
AI: We plan to add an AI component to our project to increase the success of our app.

Threats: 
Other app competitors: There are a lot of popular study apps that may cause our app to be less popular.
Technical Issues: After first launching the app, there may be bugs and security issues that affect StudyBuddy.
